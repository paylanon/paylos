## Usage

**❅ Cherry-pick anything that takes your fancy from the dotfiles directory!**

Generally, these files goes to your ***/home/username/.config*** directory, in folders of the same name.

**❅ Alternatively, if you're running NixOS, you may choose to be adventerous and adopt paylos as your desktop config.**

This is recommended, especially for a fresh installation of NixOS. Paylos makes for a great boilerplate: it comes with all the essentials of a good Linux desktop, with the option to activate a slew of features and quirks catered to powerusers. See below for a guide to installation.
